<h3>Brief Description:</h3>
<p> This is a web application made using Python Flask framework. The application will be used for facilitating users to make blogs. The users can make blogs on it, on completion can remove them. In case in some change of plans, can edit the blog. If required, we would add an admin functionality also to make it good. I created it during Tinkerhub Foundation's online mentored learning program "Python Beyond Basics" </p>

<h3>My Experience</h3>
<p>
I learnt how to use Slack app using this program which is used by industry. Also during this program I got to explore git more.
I got to learn about the flask basics and how I can connect my app to database. Also during this program I improved my HTML-CSS basics and learnt how to build a header and a footer. I now know how to deploy my applications on Heroku anytime. Also this program got me excited with Flask development. I never had thought I could enjoy this very much. I am grateful that I got this oppportunity to be part of this program
